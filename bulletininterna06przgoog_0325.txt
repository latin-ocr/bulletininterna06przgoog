Nervous trunks. All the ten longitudinal nerves and three
transversal nervous finge, described by Oohn in D. laevis are also
found in the worm in question. In addition to them one sees here
still: 1) an inner thin nerve ring, lying on the boundary of the pro—
glottides (fig. ¹9, n. n. t. in.). towards the inner transversal museleS‚
arising from the internal or principal lateral nerve3 2) shorter similar
transversal nerves (fig. 16, n. gen.), which lie in the same horizontal
plane, but in the middle of each proglottis, near the reproductive

’ glande, and start from the middle external nervous ring, near the

median longitudinal nerves extending towards the interior.
Reproductive organs. The most important difference be-
tween D. laevis and D. sui-generis consiste in the number of the
testes. vasa efferentis and vasa deferentia. Whilst in the former
species there are only three testes, in D. sui-generis their number
varies from 3 to 7. The common number is 5 to 6 (fig. 12, 13, tes).
A more important detail is that from each testis proceed several
vasa efferentis, in various numbers, 2 to 5'(fig. 14, v. ef.). Winding
many times and joining one another, they form a very much com-
plicated net of canals7 which opens into the proximal ends of both
- vasa deferentia (fig. 14, v. def). It is interesting to note that those
proglottides which do not possess the middle testis (fig. 14) contain
nevertheless a similar net (fig. 20, r. ef. )‚ a fact which can only

be explained by the supposition that the testis disappeared‚ leaving
however its vasa efferentis..

The aut-hor considers the cells surrounding the seminal vesicle
(fig. 14, c. p.) as glandular, producing an albuminoide fluid, in
which the spermatozoons swim and which fills the vesicle‚ also the
second little vesicle near the circus-pouch and, in the older proglot-
tides‚ both vaginae and the vagina communis (fig. 17). The hooks
upon the cirrus (fig. 15) resemble those in D. laevis according to
the description of J acobi (and contra (John). In the structure of
the female reproductive organs there is no great difference between
D. laevis and D. sui-generis. The vagina communis is here however
not „eine kleine Erweiterung“‚ as·Cohn says (2) in D. laevis, but
a large long canal‚ as shewn by fig. 17 (vg. e.).

All the other details in the anatomy of the tapeworm in ques-

tion are evident from the adjoined drawings (fig. 12—20) and
require no further explanation.
