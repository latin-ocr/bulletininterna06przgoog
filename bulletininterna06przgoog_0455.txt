obtained E. Schunck ¹). This author isolated from faeces of a cow
a substance, which he called scatocyanin, the chloroformic solution
of which showed a spectrum identical with that of phyllocyanin, but
whose solutions are crimson. With the same problem I myself
have been occupied, hoping to find in the faeces of herbivora re-
duction products of chlomphyll. I expected to find there at least
urobilin which might have been formed by spontaenous oxidation of
haemopyrroline, which, as has been shown by Nencki and myself²)>
is the final reduction product of chlorophyll and its coloured dei-iva*-
tives. However various experimenta gave a negative result in this
respect, and instead I came across another body which at the first
glauce had much likeness to'Schu‘nck's scatocyanin and might at
first be taken for the latter, but a more¹ minute examination poin-
ted with certainty to the conclusion that the two substances arc
quite different. The comparison of the substance obtained by my—
self, which I propose to call phylloerythrine, with Schunck's scatocy-
anin could have been carried out only on the basis of spestroscopic
studieS, as Schunck's substance, judging from the drawings given
by this author, possesses very characteristic optical propertieS.

I obtained phylloerythrine in the following manner. Fresh faeces
of a cow, fed on fresh grass only, was extracted in the cold with
chloroform. The extract obtained possessed an olive green colour.
After filtering from the undissolved substances the chloroform was
distilled off. During the latter process, or after standing for some
time of the residue. there were formed violet glittering crystalla,
which represent the new substance, phylloerythrine. In order to
purify it the crystalls were first treated with cold chloroform, which
removes a great amount of impurities, leaving the crystalls already
in a comparatively pure state. In order to remove the last traces
of impurities. the crystalls were first boiled with alcohol in which
they are scarcely soluble and then recrystallised twice from boil—
ing chloroform. On account of the small solubility in the last
named solvent the recrystallisation is done suitably in a Soxhlet
extracting apparatus. The crystalls obtained in this way appear,
when examined through a microscop, well developed. The follow-
ing forms are found most frequently:
