In mass the crystalls appear to be coloured dark brownish red
violet, but single crystalls observed through a magnifying glass
possess a brownish colour. The solution in chloroform shows a cherry
red colour and does not fluoresc. Concentrated solutions cause in
the spectrum three bande, and more diluted ones four, the position
of which corresponds to the following wave lengths:

Band I: λ - 642 -- 640
„ II: λ - 606 - 581
„ 111: λ - 577 - 557
„ IV: λ - 536 - 515

The first band is very indistinct‚ faint and narrow and plainly
visible only in more concentrated solutions, The second and third
bands unite in concentrated solutione, in more diluted the second
is placed on the D line and appears broader but fainter than the
third band. Lastly the fourth, behind the E line is still saintet
than the second band. According to their intensities these hands
may be placed therefore in the following order:

111, 11, 1v‚ 1.

Scatocyanin Schunck's causes in cbloroformic solutions five hands
„almost identical with those of phyllocyanin“‚ and differs therefore
very considerably from phylloerythrine.

The absorption spectrum of acetic acid solutions of phylloery-
thrine does not differ very considerably from that of chloroformic
solutions. The first band however which appears already faint in the
latter solutions is still saintet, scarcely noticeable in acetic aoid
solutions. The second and third hands occupy nearly the same
positions in both caseS‚ but they do not differ so markedly as
regards the intensity‚ and the third band has a very distinct sha-
dow on the more refrangible side. The fourth band in the green
part of the spectrum differs but little from the corresponding band
shown by the chloroformic solution. In wave lengths the positions
of these bands may be expressed as follows:
