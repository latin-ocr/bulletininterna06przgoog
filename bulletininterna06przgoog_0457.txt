Scatocyanin possesses according to Schunck a very different
spectrum in acetic acid solutions. According to him the first band
of scatocyanin is placed on the D line, the fourth just behind E
and between them are still tw0, more or less well marked, hands,
a spectrum distinctly different from that of phylloerythrine.

Under the influence of hydrochloric aeid the spectrum and colour
of an acetic acid solution of phylloerythrine undergoes a very cha-
racteristic change. The colour turns bluish violet and if sufficiently
diluted7 the solution causes four bands in positions which differ
widely from those occupied by the original bands. In the orange
we have now two narrow faint hands, behind the sodium line a broad
dark band and finally in the green a badly defined faint band,
The positions of these bands are:

Band 1: λ - 625 - 615
„ 11: 2—615—606
„ 111: 2—584— 556
„ IV: λ -— about 536 the less refrangible side.

’ In concentrated solutions the two first hands unite into one, the
second draws closer towards the Na line and the fourth appears
more distinet.

Concentrated sulphuric aeid dissolves phylloerythrine with a grass
green colour and the solution causes several badly defined hands,
except the first in the red which is well developed. In this respect
phylloerythrine reminds one of scatocyanin. As regards the absor-
ption of light of shorter wave length, I found that very dilute
chloroformic solutions of phylloerythrine cause two bands, one in
front of kg, the other behind the latter line and on diluting still
more this second band in the more refrangible part disappears
altogether. (Plate XVI).

The chemical properties of phylloerythrine unfortunately could
not be investigated closely for want of a sufficient quantity of the
substance. I have only been able to ascertain that despite its in-
solubitity in alkalies phylloerythrine forms compounds with salts of
