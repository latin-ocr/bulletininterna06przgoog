certain metals such as copper and zinc. We have here either a case
of formation of ordinary salts or double compounds similar to those
formed by phyllocyanin, which have been studied so thoroughly
by Ε. Schunck. The acetic acid solution of phylloerythrine treated
with zinc acetate turns green, red by transmitted light. In the
spectrum it causes three hands:

Band 1: λ -’- 628 - 603
„ II: λ - 575 - 559-
„ III: λ — 533 —- 517

An a-nalogous compound is formed by copper acetate.

Phylloerythrine possessos also basic properties as shown by the
changes caused in its spectrum by mineral acida
“ Taking into account all the properties of phylloerythrine as de-
scribed above, the conclusion may be drawn that this substance is
related closely to phylloporphyrin‚- obtained from chlorophyll by
the action· of alkalies at high tempera-tures, and that therefore the
change undergone by chlorophyll, when passing through the animal
body, is far more energetic than was supposed hitherto to he the
case. A further study of this new and interesting substance I hope
to be able to undertake later on. “

Faeces of cows fed on materials not containing chlorophyll
do not yield phylloerythrine‚ a proof that the latter substance is
really a derivative of chlorophyll and not of the red colouring
matter of the blood.
