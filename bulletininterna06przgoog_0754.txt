traces.

Meet-nere haemin. Γ* preparation. l¹s2 liters of water were heated
to 950, acidulated by adding 5001110 1010 solution of Η2 804, and mi-
xed with 5000m3 of blood. The precipitate was filtered off in a fil- ,
ter prese, mixed with 2bOem⁸of aleohol and pressed again. The pu-
rified precipitate was next mixed w'ith SOOem³ of 01001101 to which
801113 of 00110. sulphurie aeid were added, stired for an bour and
filtered. The filtrate heated to the boii, 4em⁸ of 25010 hydroehlorio
aeid added, and left to crystallize. The crystals obtained were not
well‘ developed, they possessed the shape of 11001110ος unerystallized
matter was also present. The analysis gave: 6834, 6810, 6879010 Ο,
819010, 85401οΝ and 172, 1·81010 OC² H5.

Second preparation. The procedure differed from the foregoing
in as 11111011, as the addition of hydroehlorio aeid took place in the
eold and the liquore left to crystallize at a temperature of 250.
In this manner nearly reetangular platee were obtained which, on
being analyzed, gave 6821010, 682800 03 869010 N 870010 N.
1·06010 ΟΟ0 H5, 1·13010 OC, Ηο.

Third preparation. The treatment with hydroehlorie aeid took
plaee this time at a still lower temperature namely at 14⁰, and
the solution left at this temperature for 24 heure. The precipitate
obtained has been amorphous and 0011111 not be crystallized either
from aeetie aeid or 01001101.

The fourth preparation was obtained similarly to the second, but
the treatment with hydroohlorie aoid took plaee- at the temperatum
of the boil and kept at it for 1112 hours. The substance obtained
was amorphous and gave on being analyzed 64 76⁰s0 C, 754010 Ν,
861010 002 H5.

The fifth preparation, was obtained like the second, but the
treating with hydroehlorie aeid took place at 500. Well developed
crystals were this time obtained, which resembled those of the
second preparation, and did not appreciatly alter, even at the boil,
by hydroehlorie aeid. The crystals were next reerystallized using
a.. method similar to that of Sohalfejew, but with the differenee, that
instead of quinine, dilute ammonia, and instead of ehloroform water
had been used, (4 gr. haemin, 501113 ammonia and 200em⁸ H2O).
The solution has been filtered quiekly and poured into boiling
aeetie aoid, which had been previously saturated with sodium 01110-
