ride. The crystals obtained resembled in every respect acetbaemin
and contained 62·94⁰J0 C, 8·12⁰J0, 862010 N and 03Ὓο OG, H5.

The conversion of Moerners haemin into acethaemin may be
carried out just as easily. if not easier, using the corresponding bro-
mine compound.

Slxfll preparation. 25 liters of an alcoholic solution of haemin,
prepared similarly as in the case of the first preparation, were trea-
ted with a 10⁰]o solution of hydrobromic acid, in the following
manner:

a) ll, litre of the solution was treated at once with 1501113 of
the hydrobromic acid named, and left to stand to crystallize. The
crystals obtained varied in character, predominantly flat prisms
were found. A determination of ethoxylgroups gave 2·25⁰s0 002 H5,

b) the remaining 2 litres were heated to 50⁰ and treated with
5001113 of hydrobromic aeid of 10⁰so· This time crystals were obtai-
ned in the shape of marble8‚ which contained 6·00⁰s, OC, H5.

c) the mother liquor from b, containing still a considerable amo-
unt of colouring matter, was treated with hydrochloric acid. After
standing for some time, there were deposited crystals in the shape
of marbles and needles, which were dissolved in 400cm⁸ of alcohol,
hydrochloric acid added, and the mixture kept at the boil for some
time. After cooling crystals were deposited in the shape of marbles,
although not well developed. They contained. according to a deter—
mination of ethoxylic groups —-— 8·9⁰l0 OQ H5.

Seventh preparation. 2 gr. of the preparation VI b, were dissol
ved in lOOcm⁸ of chloroform, two gramms of quinine added, and the
solution obtained poured into 50001113, of glacial acetic aeid, saturated
with potassium bromide. After cooling splendidly developed crystals
were formed. resembling in every particular those of ordinary
acethaemin3 they contained however a small amount of chlorine,
a fact which explains sufficiently the somewhat high amount of
carbon found in them, namely 59660βο C. They were also not quite
free from ethoxylic groups (found 0·89⁰l0), but there cannot
be any doubt that another recrystallisation, which could not be
carried out for want of a sufficient quantity of the substance,
would have lead to a product quite free from an admixture of
acethaemin - ethers.

It is highly probable that acethaemin is the first coloured
decomposition product of haemoglobin, that this name cannot in
